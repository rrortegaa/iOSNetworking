/**
 
    A closure is bassicaly a function that can be handled as a variable
 
 */


// Here Im defining a variable that will hold a closure that takes nothing and returns nothing.
var aClosure: () -> Void
// Here Im defining a variable that will hold a closure that takes nothing and returns an Integer
var aReturningClosure: () -> Int
// Here Im defining a variable that will hold a closure that takes an Integer and returns nothing
var aClosureWithInput: (Int) -> Void


// This is how we would assign a closure to its variable

    print("This is a returning closure")
    return 0
}

// To execute a closure would be like a function
aClosure()

// Closures can be optional types too for example
var anOptionalClosure: (() -> Void)?


// To invoke an optional closure we must put a ? before the parenthesis ()
anOptionalClosure?()

    Another way to pass a closure with a cleaner syntax would be like this. But, in order to pass the closure like this, the closure parameter
     must be the last parameter of the function parameter

/**
 While working with escpaing closures defined inside a class. We must consider the following
 
  If we are going to use a global attribute or call a function defined in the class we must CAPTURE a reference of the class, by doing this
 
        asyncronousWork { [weak self] in
     
        }
 
 The *weak* reserved word indicates tha the reference captured of the class instance is the type of weak, and by doing that we can avoid a posible
 memory leak caused by the ARC (Automatic Reference Counting). Another thing to take into consideration is that by capturing the class instance with a weak reference, that reference has to be treated like an optional

 We should never use both of those examples because, on example (1) we could make a memory leak by creating a strong reference cycle, where ARC will never deallocate the reference of the class and the closure, and if the closure is called again, it will create another reference of the class and the closure, even if there is already a reference of the closure and the class. On example (2) by using *unowned* the reference captured of the class is an *implicity unwrapped optional* (it is equivalent to declare an optional like this *var optional: Int! *  which is a very bad practice) and use that reference is very risky because if the ARC deallocates the reference of the class before we use it on the closure, we will face a reference with a *nil* value and therefore the app will crash.
